\usage{
waveletARIMA(
  wavelet.components = NULL,
  sim.year.num = NULL,
  sim.num = 1000,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wavelet.components}{A list or matrix where each column (or list element) is a numeric vector corresponding to a wavelet component (low-frequency signal or noise).}

\item{sim.year.num}{Integer. Desired length (number of years or timesteps) of each simulated series.}

\item{sim.num}{Integer. Number of synthetic series to produce. Default: 1000.}

\item{seed}{Optional. Integer random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A matrix of dimension \code{sim.year.num} x \code{sim.num}, where each column is a synthetic time series realization.
}
\description{
Simulates synthetic time series by modeling each wavelet component (signal or noise)
with an ARIMA model, and then summing the simulated components.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simulate 10 synthetic annual series (length 30) from two "wavelet" components
set.seed(42)
wavelet.components <- list(
  signal = sin(2 * pi * 1:30 / 8) + rnorm(30, 0, 0.2), # Low-freq
  noise  = rnorm(30, 0, 0.5)
)
result <- waveletARIMA(wavelet.components, sim.year.num = 30, sim.num = 10, seed = 123)
dim(result) # Should be 30 x 10
matplot(result, type = "l", lty = 1, main = "Synthetic Wavelet-ARIMA Realizations")
}
