\arguments{
\item{sim_annual_prcp}{Numeric vector of length `n_years`. Synthetic
annual precipitation totals generated by the annual model (e.g., WARM),
indexed by simulated year.}

\item{obs_annual_prcp}{Numeric vector. Observed annual precipitation totals
corresponding to historical water years.}

\item{obs_daily_prcp}{Numeric vector. Observed daily precipitation values
(no leap days), aligned with `obs_dates_df`.}

\item{obs_daily_temp}{Numeric vector. Observed daily temperature values
(no leap days), aligned with `obs_dates_df`.}

\item{year_start}{Integer. First simulation year (calendar year if
`year_start_month == 1`, otherwise first water year).}

\item{realization_idx}{Integer. Realization index, used to perturb the random
seed so that multiple realizations are independent.}

\item{n_years}{Integer. Number of simulated years.}

\item{obs_dates_df}{Data frame containing observed date information. Must
include columns `date`, `month`, `day`, and `wyear`.}

\item{sim_dates_df}{Data frame containing simulated date information
(no leap days). Must include columns `month`, `day`, and `wyear`.}

\item{year_start_month}{Integer in 1:12. First month of the simulation year.
Use 1 for calendar-year simulations, or another month for water-year
simulations.}

\item{annual_knn_n}{Integer. Number of historical years sampled in the
annual KNN step.}

\item{wet_q}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile used to define the wet
threshold for daily precipitation states.}

\item{extreme_q}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile used to define the very
wet (extreme) precipitation threshold.}

\item{dry_spell_factor}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly adjustment
factors controlling dry spell persistence in the Markov chain.}

\item{wet_spell_factor}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly adjustment
factors controlling wet spell persistence in the Markov chain.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Base random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A `Date` vector of length equal to `nrow(sim_dates_df)`, giving the
resampled observed dates corresponding to each simulated day.
}
\description{
Resamples daily precipitation and temperature sequences by combining:
\itemize{
  \item annual K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) selection of observed years,
  \item a three-state Markov chain for wet and dry spell persistence,
  \item daily KNN resampling on precipitation and temperature anomalies.
}

The function supports both calendar-year and water-year simulations.
The regime is inferred automatically from `year_start_month`:
if `year_start_month == 1`, calendar-year logic is used; otherwise, water-year
logic is assumed.
}
\details{
For each simulated year, a subset of observed water years is selected
using annual KNN matching against `sim_annual_prcp`. Daily weather is then
generated sequentially:

\enumerate{
  \item The first day of each simulated year is sampled from observed
        days matching the simulated month and day.
  \item Subsequent days are generated using a Markov chain to simulate
        wet and dry states.
  \item Conditional on the simulated state, candidate observed days are
        selected using calendar constraints and expanded search windows.
  \item A daily KNN step on precipitation and temperature anomalies is
        used to select the next-day weather values.
}

In calendar-year mode (`year_start_month == 1`), transitions that cross
December to January are explicitly excluded to avoid cross-year
contamination.
