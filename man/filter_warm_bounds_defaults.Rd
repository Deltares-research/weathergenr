\title{WARM filtering default bounds}
\usage{
filter_warm_bounds_defaults()
}
\value{
Named list of default bounds using snake case keys.
}
\description{
Returns internal default bounds for \code{filter_warm_pool()}.

The defaults are designed to be moderately selective for annual records on the
order of 50 to 100 years. Typical usage is to override only a small subset of
entries via \code{filter_bounds = list(...)} while keeping the remaining
defaults unchanged.
}
\details{
The returned list contains thresholds and controls used by the filtering and
relaxation logic.

Distributional tolerances:
\describe{
  \item{mean}{Maximum absolute relative difference in the mean between a
  simulated realization and the observed series. Default 0.03.}
  \item{sd}{Maximum absolute relative difference in standard deviation between
  a simulated realization and the observed series. Default 0.03.}
}

Tail mass behavior:
\describe{
  \item{tail_low_p}{Lower quantile used to define the low tail threshold in the
  observed series. Default 0.20.}
  \item{tail_high_p}{Upper quantile used to define the high tail threshold in
  the observed series. Default 0.80.}
  \item{tail_tol_log}{Maximum absolute log difference between simulated and
  observed tail mass metrics. Default log(1.03).}
  \item{tail_eps}{Positive constant used for numerical stability in log
  transforms. Default 1e-5.}

\describe{

  that must be matched. Default 1.0.}
