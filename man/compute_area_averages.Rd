\title{Compute Area-Averaged Daily and Annual Climate Series}
\usage{
compute_area_averages(obs_data, wyear_idx, wyear, vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs_data}{Named list of data frames (one per grid cell).}

\item{wyear_idx}{Integer vector of row indices to extract from each data frame.}

\item{wyear}{Integer vector of water years corresponding to wyear_idx.}

\item{vars}{Character vector of variable names to average.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{daily}{Data frame of area-averaged daily values with columns for
    each variable plus wyear.}
  \item{annual}{Tibble of annual means with columns wyear plus each variable.}
}
}
\description{
Computes area-averaged (mean across grid cells) daily climate values and
aggregates them to annual means by water year.
