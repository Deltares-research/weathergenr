thresholds separating wet and very wet states, aligned to month_order.}

\item{month_order}{Integer vector of length 12 defining the simulated ordering
of months (for example 1:12 for calendar years or c(10:12, 1:9) for
October-start water years).}

\description{
Estimates month-specific transition probabilities for a three-state
precipitation occurrence Markov chain (dry, wet, very wet) from observed
daily precipitation data, and maps these probabilities onto a simulated
time axis.

Transition probabilities are inferred from observed lag-1 to lag-0
precipitation pairs using month-dependent wet and extreme thresholds.
A Dirichlet-type smoothing is applied to avoid zero-probability transitions,
with the effective smoothing strength decreasing automatically with the
number of observed transitions per month.

The function supports both calendar-year and water-year simulations.
The regime is inferred from month_order: if month_order[1] == 1,
calendar-year logic is used; otherwise, water-year logic is assumed.

Optional spell-persistence modifiers are applied to dry and wet states to
influence transition persistence. After these adjustments, transition
probabilities are explicitly normalized to ensure stochastic validity
(non-negativity and rows summing to one).

The estimated monthly transition probabilities are assigned to all simulated
days that fall within the target simulation year and corresponding calendar
month.
}
\details{
Precipitation occurrence states are defined as:
\describe{
  \item{Dry}{Precipitation less than or equal to the monthly wet threshold}
  \item{Wet}{Precipitation greater than the wet threshold and less than or
             equal to the extreme threshold}
  \item{Very wet}{Precipitation greater than the extreme threshold}
}

All transition-probability rows are explicitly normalized after smoothing and
spell adjustments to ensure valid Markov-chain behavior.
