\title{Plot Global Wavelet Power Spectrum Using ggplot2}
\usage{
waveletPlot(
  power.period = NULL,
  power.signif = NULL,
  power.obs = NULL,
  power.sim = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{power.period}{Numeric vector. Fourier periods (typically in years) returned by wavelet analysis.}

\item{power.signif}{Numeric vector. Significance thresholds for each period, e.g., the 95th percentile global power at each scale.}

\item{power.obs}{Numeric vector. Observed global wavelet power spectrum.}

\item{power.sim}{Optional numeric matrix. Simulated global wavelet spectra (each column = one simulation); if provided, displays simulation envelopes and mean.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object representing the wavelet power spectrum plot.
}
\description{
This function generates a publication-quality plot of the global wavelet power spectrum using `ggplot2`.
It can display observed power spectra, significance thresholds, and simulated spectra as envelopes or ribbons.
Designed to visually compare observed versus simulated spectral power across Fourier periods.
}
\details{
The function provides a flexible visualization of wavelet spectra, supporting both single observed spectra and comparisons to simulated ensembles.
\itemize{
  \item When `power.sim` is `NULL`, only the observed power and significance threshold are plotted.
  \item When `power.sim` is provided, the plot includes:
    \itemize{
      \item The envelope (min/max) of the simulated spectra as a ribbon,
      \item The mean of the simulations as a solid line,
      \item The observed spectrum and significance threshold as lines.
    }
}
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

\describe{
  \item{Red dashed line}{Significance threshold}
  \item{Blue line}{Observed power spectrum}
  \item{Black line}{Mean of simulated spectra (if provided)}
  \item{Gray ribbon}{Range of simulated spectra (min/max; if provided)}
}
}

# Example data
period <- seq(1, 64, by = 1)
signif <- rep(1500, length(period))
obs <- 2000 * exp(-((period - 15) / 10)^2) + 1000

# Plot observed and simulated spectra
