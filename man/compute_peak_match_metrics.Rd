\title{Compute significant peak match metrics for one simulated spectrum}
\usage{
compute_peak_match_metrics(
  gws_sim,
  period,
  obs_peaks,
  period_tol = 0.5,
  mag_tol_log = log(1.5),
  eps = 1e-10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gws_sim}{Numeric vector. Simulated global wavelet spectrum aligned to
\code{period}.}

\item{period}{Numeric vector. Period grid for \code{gws_sim}.}

\item{obs_peaks}{Data frame. Significant observed peaks returned by
\code{identify_significant_peaks()}.}

\item{period_tol}{Numeric scalar. Maximum allowed absolute difference in
log2 period between an observed peak period and a simulated candidate period.}

\item{mag_tol_log}{Numeric scalar. Maximum allowed absolute log ratio between
simulated and observed peak power.}

\item{eps}{Numeric scalar. Positive constant used for numerical stability.}
}
\value{
Named list with:
  \code{peak_match_frac} fraction of observed peaks that were matched,
  \code{peak_mag_mean_abs_log_ratio} mean absolute log ratio for matched peaks,
  or NA if no peaks were matched.
}
\description{
Compares a simulated global wavelet spectrum to a set of significant observed
peaks. For each observed peak, a match is declared if the simulated spectrum
contains a local maximum within a period tolerance and the matched power is
within a magnitude tolerance.

Period tolerance is measured in log2 period space. Magnitude tolerance is
measured as the absolute log ratio between simulated and observed power.
