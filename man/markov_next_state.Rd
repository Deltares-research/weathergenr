\title{Determine Next State in a First-Order Markov Chain}
\usage{
markov_next_state(prev_state, rn, idx, p00, p01, p10, p11, p20, p21)
}
\arguments{
\item{prev_state}{Integer. The current (previous) state (0, 1, or 2).}

\item{rn}{Numeric. A random number in [0, 1] used to sample the next state.}

\item{idx}{Integer. Index for selecting transition probabilities (e.g., time step or spatial location).}

\item{p00}{Numeric vector. Probability of transition from state 0 to 0.}

\item{p01}{Numeric vector. Probability of transition from state 0 to 1.}

\item{p10}{Numeric vector. Probability of transition from state 1 to 0.}

\item{p11}{Numeric vector. Probability of transition from state 1 to 1.}

\item{p20}{Numeric vector. Probability of transition from state 2 to 0.}

\item{p21}{Numeric vector. Probability of transition from state 2 to 1.}
}
\value{
Integer. The next state (0, 1, or 2).
}
\description{
Given the previous state and a random number `rn`, this function returns the next
state in a 3-state first-order Markov chain. The transition probabilities are
state- and index-specific.
}
\details{
States are typically defined as:
- 0: Dry
- 1: Wet
- 2: Extreme

The transition is determined using cumulative probabilities for the transitions
to state 0 and 1. Any remaining probability is assigned to state 2.
}
\examples{
# Suppose we're at time step 5 with current state = 1
set.seed(123)
rn <- runif(1)
markov_next_state(
  prev_state = 1,
  rn = rn,
  idx = 5,
  p00 = rep(0.7, 10),
  p01 = rep(0.2, 10),
  p10 = rep(0.3, 10),
  p11 = rep(0.4, 10),
  p20 = rep(0.1, 10),
  p21 = rep(0.3, 10)
)
