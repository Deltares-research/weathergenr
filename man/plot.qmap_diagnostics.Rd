\title{Plot diagnostics for quantile-mapping validation}
\usage{
\method{plot}{qmap_diagnostics}(x, which = c("all", "moments", "quantiles", "extremes", "monthly"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"qmap_diagnostics"} as returned by
\code{\link{validate_quantile_mapping}}.}

\item{which}{Character scalar. Which plot to produce:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"all"}: return/arrange all available panels.
  \item \code{"moments"}: percent changes in distribution moments.
  \item \code{"quantiles"}: scatter of original vs adjusted quantiles.
  \item \code{"extremes"}: comparison of mean exceedances across thresholds.
  \item \code{"monthly"}: monthly mean comparison (requires \code{x$monthly}).
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored). Included for S3 method compatibility.}
}
\value{
If \code{which = "all"}:
\itemize{
  \item If \pkg{gridExtra} is available, the arranged grob is drawn and returned
  invisibly (side effect).
  \item Otherwise, a named list of ggplot objects is returned.
}
If \code{which != "all"}, a single ggplot object is returned.
}
\description{
S3 plot method for objects of class \code{"qmap_diagnostics"} produced by
\code{\link{validate_quantile_mapping}}. Generates one or more ggplot-based diagnostic
figures summarizing moment changes, quantile preservation, extreme-value behavior,
and (optionally) monthly mean patterns.
}
\details{
This method requires \pkg{ggplot2}. If \code{which = "monthly"}, it also requires
\pkg{tidyr} for reshaping. If \code{which = "all"} and \pkg{gridExtra} is installed,
plots are arranged in a multi-panel layout; otherwise a named list of ggplot objects
is returned.
