\title{Check if simulated spectrum matches observed peaks}
\usage{
compute_peak_match_fraction(
  gws_sim,
  gws_obs,
  period,
  obs_peaks,
  period_tol = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gws_sim}{Numeric vector. Simulated GWS.}

\item{gws_obs}{Numeric vector. Observed GWS.}

\item{period}{Numeric vector. Periods.}

\item{obs_peaks}{Data frame. Observed peak information from identify_prominent_peaks.}

\item{period_tol}{Numeric. Relative tolerance for period matching (log2 scale).}
}
\value{
Numeric. Fraction of observed peaks matched (0 to 1).
}
\description{
For each observed peak, checks if the simulated spectrum has elevated power
at or near that period.
