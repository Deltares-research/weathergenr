\title{Normalize a Probability Vector with Robust Fallback Handling}
\usage{
normalize_probs(p, fallback = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric vector of (unnormalized) probabilities or weights.
Non-finite values (\code{NA}, \code{NaN}, \code{Inf}) and negative values
are set to zero prior to normalization.}

\item{fallback}{Optional numeric vector to return when \code{p} has zero
total mass after cleaning. If \code{NULL} (default), a uniform distribution
of length \code{length(p)} is returned.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of probabilities summing to one. If a fallback is used, the
returned vector is either \code{fallback} or a uniform distribution.
}
\description{
Normalizes a numeric vector to sum to one, treating non-finite and negative
values as zero. If the total mass is zero after cleaning, a fallback
distribution is returned instead.
}
\details{
This helper is intended for internal use in stochastic or probabilistic
workflows where degenerate or numerically unstable probability vectors may
arise. The function does not check that \code{fallback} sums to one; this is
assumed to be ensured by the caller.
}
\examples{
p <- c(0.2, NA, -0.1, 0.5)
normalize_probs(p)

normalize_probs(c(0, 0, 0))

normalize_probs(c(0, 0, 0), fallback = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1))
