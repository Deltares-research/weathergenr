\title{Fill NA Values with the Nearest Non-NA Neighbor}
\usage{
fill_nearest(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector possibly containing \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector with missing values filled. If \code{x} is all \code{NA},
  it is returned unchanged.
}
\description{
Fills missing values in a numeric vector by propagating the nearest available
non-missing value. This is a deterministic forward-fill followed by a backward-fill.
It is mainly used to stabilize curves after interpolation (e.g., regridded spectra).
