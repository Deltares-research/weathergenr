\title{Estimate Monthly Potential Evapotranspiration (Hargreaves Method)}
\usage{
pet_hargreaves(months, temp, tdiff, lat)
}
\arguments{
\item{months}{Integer vector (1-12). Calendar months corresponding
to each PET estimate.}

\item{temp}{Numeric vector. Mean monthly air temperature (degrees C).}

\item{tdiff}{Numeric vector. Monthly diurnal temperature range
(Tmax ??? Tmin, degrees C). Must be non-negative.}

\item{lat}{Numeric scalar. Latitude in decimal degrees
(positive north, negative south).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of monthly potential evapotranspiration values
in mm/day, with length equal to `length(months)`.
}
\description{
Computes monthly mean potential evapotranspiration (PET) using the
Hargreaves temperature-based method. PET is estimated from mean air
temperature, diurnal temperature range, and extraterrestrial radiation
derived from latitude and time of year.

The implementation follows the FAO-56 formulation and returns PET
in units of millimeters per day (mm/day).
}
\details{
Extraterrestrial radiation is computed using a fixed representative
day of year for the middle of each month. Radiation is converted from
MJ m^2/day to equivalent evaporation depth using the FAO conversion
factor of 0.408.

The Hargreaves equation is:
\deqn{
PET = 0.0023 * Ra * (T + 17.8) * sqrt(Tmax - Tmin)
}
where Ra is extraterrestrial radiation.
