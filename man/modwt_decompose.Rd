\usage{
modwt_decompose(
  x,
  filter = c("la8", "haar", "d4", "d6", "d8", "la16"),
  n_levels = NULL,
  boundary = "periodic"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. Input time series.}

\item{filter}{Character. Wavelet filter name. One of:
\code{"haar"}, \code{"d4"}, \code{"d6"}, \code{"d8"},
\code{"la8"}, \code{"la16"} (default: \code{"la8"}).}

\item{n_levels}{Integer. Number of decomposition levels. If \code{NULL},
uses a conservative default based on series length and filter width.
This is a stability heuristic, not a mathematical requirement of MODWT.}

\item{boundary}{Character. Boundary handling method. Currently only
\code{"periodic"} is supported (circular convolution).}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"modwt_result"} containing:
\describe{
  \item{coefficients}{List from waveslim::modwt with W1...WJ and VJ (scaling).}
  \item{filter}{Character. Filter name used.}
  \item{n_levels}{Integer. Number of decomposition levels (J).}
  \item{n}{Integer. Original series length.}
  \item{boundary}{Character. Boundary method used.}
  \item{filter_length}{Integer. Length of the wavelet filter.}
}
}
\description{
Performs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform using a specified
wavelet filter. MODWT is shift-invariant and provides additive multi-resolution
decomposition at dyadic scales (powers of 2).

This function wraps \code{waveslim::modwt()} with additional input validation
and a standardized return structure.
}
\details{
The number of decomposition levels is capped using a stability heuristic:
\code{min(floor(log2(n)), floor(log2((n-1)/(L-1)+1)))} where L is the filter
length. This ensures the effective filter support does not dominate the
series length, reducing boundary artifacts.
