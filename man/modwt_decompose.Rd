\title{Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT)}
\usage{
modwt_decompose(
  x,
  filter = c("la8", "haar", "d4", "d6", "d8", "la16"),
  n_levels = NULL,
  boundary = "periodic"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. Input time series. Must be regularly spaced and contain no missing
values.}

\item{filter}{Character. Wavelet filter name. One of \code{"la8"} (default), \code{"haar"},
\code{"d4"}, \code{"d6"}, \code{"d8"}, \code{"la16"}.}

\item{n_levels}{Integer scalar or NULL. Number of decomposition levels (J). If NULL, a
conservative default is used based on series length and filter width.}

\item{boundary}{Character. Boundary handling method. Only \code{"periodic"} is supported.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"modwt_result"}.
The object contains:
- \code{coefficients}: coefficients returned by \code{waveslim::modwt()} (W1...WJ and VJ)
- \code{filter}: filter name used
- \code{n_levels}: number of decomposition levels (J)
- \code{n}: series length
- \code{boundary}: boundary method
- \code{filter_length}: length of the wavelet filter
}
\description{
Performs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform using a specified wavelet filter.
MODWT is shift-invariant and provides additive multi-resolution decomposition at dyadic
scales (powers of 2).

This function wraps \code{waveslim::modwt()} with input validation and a standardized
return object.
}
\details{
The recommended maximum number of levels is capped using a stability heuristic based on
series length and filter width. The cap is intended to reduce boundary artifacts and
unstable behavior on short records; it is not a mathematical requirement of MODWT.
