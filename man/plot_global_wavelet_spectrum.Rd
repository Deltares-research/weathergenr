\title{Plot Global Wavelet Spectrum}
\usage{
plot_global_wavelet_spectrum(
  power.period,
  power.signif,
  power.obs,
  power.sim = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{power.period}{Numeric vector. Fourier periods (e.g., years) corresponding
to the wavelet scales used in the analysis.}

\item{power.signif}{Numeric vector. Significance threshold for the global wavelet
power at each period (e.g., 95% confidence level).}

\item{power.obs}{Numeric vector. Observed global wavelet power spectrum.}

\item{power.sim}{Optional numeric matrix. Simulated global wavelet spectra with
dimensions `[n_periods, n_simulations]`. When provided, the simulation range
(min-max) and ensemble mean are shown.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object representing the global wavelet power spectrum.
}
\description{
Generate a publication-quality plot of the global wavelet power spectrum (GWS).
The function supports comparison between an observed spectrum and an ensemble
of simulated spectra, displayed as an envelope and mean.
}
\details{
The global wavelet spectrum (GWS) summarizes wavelet power across time for each
Fourier period. This plot is typically used to identify dominant variability
scales and to compare observed behavior against stochastic or climate-driven
ensembles.

Plot behavior:

- Always plots the observed GWS and its significance threshold.
- When `power.sim` is provided:
  - The ensemble envelope (min-max) is shown as a ribbon.
  - The ensemble mean is shown as a solid line.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{


- **Blue solid line**: Observed global wavelet spectrum
- **Red dashed line**: Significance threshold
- **Black solid line**: Ensemble mean (if provided)
- **Gray ribbon**: Ensemble envelope (min-max; if provided)
