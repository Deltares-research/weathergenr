\title{Plot Global Wavelet Spectrum}
\usage{
plot_global_wavelet_spectrum(
  power.period,
  power.signif,
  power.obs,
  power.sim = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{power.period}{Numeric vector. Fourier periods, for example in years,
corresponding to the wavelet scales used in the analysis.}

\item{power.signif}{Numeric vector. Significance threshold for the global
wavelet power at each period, for example a 95 percent confidence level.}

\item{power.obs}{Numeric vector. Observed global wavelet power spectrum.}

\item{power.sim}{Optional numeric matrix. Simulated global wavelet spectra.
Rows correspond to periods and columns correspond to individual simulations.
When provided, the simulation range and ensemble mean are shown.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the global wavelet power spectrum.
}
\description{
Generates a publication quality plot of the global wavelet power spectrum.
The function supports comparison between an observed spectrum and an ensemble
of simulated spectra, displayed using an envelope and an ensemble mean.
}
\details{
The global wavelet spectrum summarizes wavelet power across time for each
Fourier period. This plot is commonly used to identify dominant variability
scales and to compare observed behavior against stochastic or climate driven
ensembles.

Plot behavior is as follows:
\itemize{
  \item The observed global wavelet spectrum and its significance threshold
  are always plotted.
  \item When simulated spectra are provided, the ensemble range is shown
  as a ribbon and the ensemble mean is shown as a solid line.
}
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

\itemize{
  \item Blue solid line: observed global wavelet spectrum
  \item Red dashed line: significance threshold
  \item Black solid line: ensemble mean, when provided
  \item Gray ribbon: ensemble envelope defined by minimum and maximum values,
  when provided
}
}

\dontrun{
period <- seq(1, 64)

simmat <- sapply(
  1:30,
