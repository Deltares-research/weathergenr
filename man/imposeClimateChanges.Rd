\arguments{
\item{climate.data}{List of data frames. Each contains daily weather for one grid cell with columns `precip`, `temp`, `temp_min`, `temp_max`, and optionally `pet`.}

\item{climate.grid}{Data frame. Metadata for each grid cell; must include a `y` column for latitude.}

\item{sim.dates}{Vector of `Date` objects. Dates for each row of the grid cell data frames.}

\item{change.factor.precip.mean}{Numeric vector (length 12). Monthly multiplicative mean factors for precipitation}

\item{change.factor.precip.variance}{Numeric vector (length 12). Monthly multiplicative variance factors for precipitation.}

\item{change.factor.temp.mean}{Numeric vector (length 12). Monthly additive temperature changes in degC}

\item{transient.temp.change}{Logical. If TRUE, temperature changes are applied gradually by year; if FALSE, they are applied as a step. Default is TRUE.}

\item{transient.precip.change}{Logical. If TRUE, precipitation changes are applied gradually by year; if FALSE, they are applied as a step. Default is TRUE.}

\item{calculate.pet}{Logical. If TRUE, recalculates PET using perturbed temperature. Default is TRUE.}

\item{compute.parallel}{Logical. If TRUE, function can be run in parallel (template code, not active by default). Default is FALSE.}

\item{num.cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel computation if used. Default is all minus one.}

\item{fit.method}{Character. Method for quantile mapping (see `quantileMapping`). Default is "mme".}
}
\value{
A list of data frames (one per grid cell) containing the weather variables after applying climate change perturbations.
}
\description{
Applies climate change perturbations to gridded daily weather data. The function modifies precipitation and temperature in each grid cell by applying mean and variance change factors (for precipitation) and additive changes (for temperature), with the option for stepwise or gradual (transient) changes over the simulation period. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) can also be recalculated using the perturbed temperature series.
}
\details{
This function is designed for climate change impact assessments, allowing flexible application of mean and variance shifts to gridded weather data. PET is recalculated using the Hargreaves method if enabled. Infinite values in the output are replaced by zero.
