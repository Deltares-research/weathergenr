\usage{
modwt_mra(
  x,
  filter = c("la8", "haar", "d4", "d6", "d8", "la16"),
  n_levels = NULL,
  boundary = "periodic",
  include_smooth = TRUE,
  max_period_frac = 1/3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. Input time series.}

\item{filter}{Character. Wavelet filter name.}

\item{n_levels}{Integer. Number of decomposition levels (J). If \code{NULL},
automatically determined based on series length, filter length, and max-period cap.}

\item{boundary}{Character. Boundary handling. Only \code{"periodic"} is supported.}

\item{include_smooth}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, includes the smooth (approximation)
component at the coarsest level (SJ).}

\item{max_period_frac}{Numeric in (0, 1]. Maximum allowed represented period as a
fraction of record length. Default is 1/3 (no structure beyond n/3).}
}
\value{
A list with additive components, periods, variance accounting, and diagnostics.
}
\description{
Extracts additive time-domain components from MODWT decomposition using
multiresolution analysis. Each component captures variance at a specific
dyadic scale band. The components sum exactly to the original series.
