\title{Compute temporal diagnostics for quantile-mapped precipitation}
\usage{
compute_temporal_diagnostics(
  value.original,
  value.adjusted,
  mon.ts,
  year.ts,
  nonzero.mask
)
}
\arguments{
\item{value.original}{Numeric vector. Original precipitation values.}

\item{value.adjusted}{Numeric vector. Adjusted precipitation values, same length as
\code{value.original}.}

\item{mon.ts}{Integer vector. Month index (1--12) for each observation.}

\item{year.ts}{Integer vector. Year index for each observation (same length as values).}

\item{nonzero.mask}{Logical vector. Mask applied to both series before aggregation
and autocorrelation calculations.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{metric}, \code{value}, and \code{assessment}.
The \code{assessment} field is populated for correlation and autocorrelation-preservation
diagnostics and set to \code{NA} for raw autocorrelation values.
}
\description{
Quantifies preservation of temporal structure by comparing annual and monthly means,
their correlations, and lag-1 autocorrelation of the (masked) daily series.
}
\details{
Annual and monthly means are computed via \code{tapply(..., mean, na.rm = TRUE)} on
the masked values. Correlations compare original vs adjusted aggregated series.
Lag-1 autocorrelation is computed using \code{stats::acf(..., lag.max = 1, plot = FALSE)}.
