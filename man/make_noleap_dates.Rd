\title{Generate 365-Day Yearly Date Sequence (No Leap Days)}
\usage{
make_noleap_dates(start_year, n_years)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_year}{Integer. The starting year of the date sequence (e.g., 2000).}

\item{n_years}{Integer. The number of years to generate (e.g., 10).}
}
\value{
A vector of `Date` objects, length `365 * n_years`, with each year containing exactly 365 days (no Feb 29).
}
\description{
Generates a sequence of daily dates for a specified number of years, always omitting February 29 (leap days).
This utility is especially useful for stochastic weather generators and synthetic climate simulations where every year
must have exactly 365 days, regardless of actual leap years in the calendar.
}
\examples{
# Generate 2 synthetic years starting from 2000, with no leap days
dates <- make_noleap_dates(2000, 2)
head(dates)
tail(dates)
any(format(dates, "\%m-\%d") == "02-29") # should be FALSE
length(dates) # should be 730 (2 years * 365)

}
