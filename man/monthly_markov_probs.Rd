\arguments{
\item{precip.lag0}{Numeric vector. Observed daily precipitation at lag 0
(current day) used to estimate state transitions.}

\item{precip.lag1}{Numeric vector. Observed daily precipitation at lag 1
(previous day) used to estimate state transitions.}

\item{month.lag0}{Integer vector (1-12). Calendar month corresponding to
precip.lag0.}

\item{month.lag1}{Integer vector (1-12). Calendar month corresponding to
precip.lag1.}

\item{year.lag0}{Optional integer vector. Calendar year or water year
corresponding to precip.lag0. If provided together with year.lag1,
transitions are restricted to same-year pairs.}

\item{year.lag1}{Optional integer vector. Calendar year or water year
corresponding to precip.lag1.}

\item{wet.threshold}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly precipitation
thresholds separating dry and wet states, aligned to month.list.}

\item{extreme.threshold}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly precipitation
thresholds separating wet and very wet states, aligned to month.list.}

\item{month.list}{Integer vector of length 12 defining the simulated ordering
of months (for example 1:12 for calendar years or c(10:12, 1:9) for
October-start water years).}

\item{sim.months}{Integer vector. Calendar month for each simulated day.}

\item{sim.water.years}{Integer vector. Simulation year (calendar or water year,
depending on regime) for each simulated day.}

factors controlling wet-state persistence.}

\item{sim.length}{Integer. Total number of simulated days. Determines the
length of the returned probability vectors.}

estimation. The effective smoothing applied in each month is
alpha / sqrt(N_m), where N_m is the number of observed transitions
in that month.}

\value{
A named list of nine numeric vectors, each of length sim.length,
representing time-varying transition probabilities:
\itemize{
  \item p00_final: P(dry to dry)
  \item p01_final: P(dry to wet)
  \item p02_final: P(dry to very wet)
  \item p10_final: P(wet to dry)
  \item p11_final: P(wet to wet)
  \item p12_final: P(wet to very wet)
  \item p20_final: P(very wet to dry)
  \item p21_final: P(very wet to wet)
  \item p22_final: P(very wet to very wet)

\description{
Estimates month-specific transition probabilities for a three-state
precipitation occurrence Markov chain (dry, wet, very wet) from observed
daily precipitation data, and maps these probabilities onto a simulated
time axis.

Transition probabilities are inferred from observed lag-1 to lag-0
precipitation pairs using month-dependent wet and extreme thresholds.
A Dirichlet-type smoothing is applied to avoid zero-probability transitions,
with the effective smoothing strength decreasing automatically with the
number of observed transitions per month.

The function supports both calendar-year and water-year simulations.
The regime is inferred from month.list: if month.list[1] == 1,
calendar-year logic is used; otherwise, water-year logic is assumed.

Optional spell-persistence modifiers are applied to dry and wet states to
influence transition persistence. After these adjustments, transition
probabilities are explicitly normalized to ensure stochastic validity
(non-negativity and rows summing to one).

The estimated monthly transition probabilities are assigned to all simulated
days that fall within the target simulation year and corresponding calendar
month.

\details{
Precipitation occurrence states are defined as:
\describe{
  \item{Dry}{Precipitation less than or equal to the monthly wet threshold}
  \item{Wet}{Precipitation greater than the wet threshold and less than or
             equal to the extreme threshold}
  \item{Very wet}{Precipitation greater than the extreme threshold}
}

All transition-probability rows are explicitly normalized after smoothing and
spell adjustments to ensure valid Markov-chain behavior.
