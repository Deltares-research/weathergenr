\title{Mean Spell Length Above or Below a Threshold}
\usage{
mean_spell_length(x, threshold = 0, below = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. Daily values of a weather variable
(for example precipitation or temperature). Missing values are not
explicitly handled and should be removed beforehand if present.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric scalar. Threshold used to classify days into
two states. Values less than or equal to the threshold are considered
"below-threshold"; values above the threshold are considered
"above-threshold".}

\item{below}{Logical. If TRUE (default), the mean length of
below-threshold spells (for example dry spells) is returned.
If FALSE, the mean length of above-threshold spells
(for example wet spells) is returned.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value giving the mean spell length (in days) for the
selected state. Returns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{NA_real_} if \code{x} has zero length,
  \item \code{0} if no spells of the selected type are present.
}
}
\description{
Computes the mean length of contiguous runs ("spells") in a numeric
time series after threshold-based classification.

The input vector is first converted to a binary occurrence series using
the supplied threshold. Consecutive days in the same state are grouped
into spells, and the mean spell length is calculated for either the
below-threshold or above-threshold state.

This function is typically used to diagnose wet or dry spell persistence
in daily precipitation or other hydro-meteorological time series and is
suitable for validating stochastic weather generators and Markov-chain
occurrence models.
}
\details{
A spell is defined as a maximal sequence of consecutive days belonging
to the same threshold-defined state. Spell lengths are computed from
transitions in the binary occurrence series derived from \code{x}.

The function treats values exactly equal to the threshold as
below-threshold. This convention should be kept consistent with other
occurrence or Markov-state definitions used in the analysis.
