\usage{
compute_spectral_match_single(
  gws_obs,
  gws_sim,
  period,
  obs_peaks,
  peak_period_tol = 0.5,
  peak_mag_tol_log = log(1.5),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gws_obs}{Numeric vector. Observed global wavelet spectrum aligned to
\code{period}.}

\item{gws_sim}{Numeric vector. Simulated global wavelet spectrum aligned to
\code{period}.}

\item{period}{Numeric vector. Period grid for both spectra.}

\item{obs_peaks}{Data frame. Significant observed peaks returned by
\code{identify_significant_peaks()}.}

\item{peak_period_tol}{Numeric scalar. Period matching tolerance in log2
period space.}

\item{peak_mag_tol_log}{Numeric scalar. Magnitude matching tolerance as an
absolute log ratio.}

\item{eps}{Numeric scalar. Positive constant used to avoid log of zero.}
}
\value{
Named list with:
  \code{spectral_cor} correlation between log transformed spectra,
  \code{peak_match_frac} fraction of significant observed peaks matched,
  \code{peak_mag_mean_abs_log_ratio} mean absolute log ratio for matched peaks.
}
\description{
Computes two spectral similarity metrics between an observed and a simulated
global wavelet spectrum:
1) correlation between log transformed spectra, and
2) significant peak match metrics relative to significant observed peaks.
