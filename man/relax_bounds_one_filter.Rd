\title{Relax bounds for one filter family}
\usage{
relax_bounds_one_filter(
  filter_name,
  bounds_env,
  wavelet_active_env,
  recompute_tailmass_fn
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_name}{Character scalar. Filter family to relax. Must be one of
\code{"mean"}, \code{"sd"}, \code{"tail_low"}, \code{"tail_high"},
\code{"wavelet"}.}

\item{bounds_env}{Environment. Environment containing the current bounds using
snake case keys. Updated in place.}

\item{wavelet_active_env}{Environment. Environment containing a logical
\code{wavelet_active} flag. May be updated in place.}

\item{recompute_tailmass_fn}{Function. Callback used to recompute tail mass
metrics when tail quantile thresholds change.}
}
\value{
Named list with:
  \code{changed} logical scalar indicating whether a bound was changed,
  \code{msg} character message describing the applied change.
}
\description{
Applies one relaxation step for a single filter family and updates the bounds
environment in place. This function is called by \code{filter_warm_pool()}.

Relaxation behavior by filter family:
\describe{
  \item{mean}{Increases the mean tolerance up to \code{relax_mean_max}.}
  \item{sd}{Increases the sd tolerance up to \code{relax_sd_max}.}
  \item{tail_low}{First increases tail tolerance, then increases
  \code{tail_low_p} in steps, recomputing tail metrics after changes.}
  \item{tail_high}{First increases tail tolerance, then decreases
  \code{tail_high_p} in steps, recomputing tail metrics after changes.}
  \item{wavelet}{Relaxes spectral correlation threshold, then relaxes peak
  match fraction, then disables peak matching, then disables wavelet filtering.}
}
