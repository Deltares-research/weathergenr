\title{Expand Index Positions by Fixed Offsets}
\usage{
expand_indices(idx, offsets, max_len)
}
\arguments{
\item{idx}{Integer vector of base index positions to be expanded.}

\item{offsets}{Integer vector of offsets to apply to each element of
\code{idx}. Offsets may be positive, negative, or zero.}

\item{max_len}{Integer. Maximum allowable index length; expanded indices are
constrained to the range \code{1:(max_len - 1)}.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of expanded index positions that satisfy the validity
constraints.
}
\description{
Expands a vector of base index positions by adding a set of integer offsets,
returning all valid index positions within a specified upper bound. This is
typically used to generate moving windows or neighborhood indices around
reference positions (e.g., expanding event days to adjacent days).
}
\details{
For each element in \code{idx}, all values in \code{offsets} are added.
Resulting indices that are less than or equal to zero, or for which
\code{index + 1 > max_len}, are discarded. The function does not enforce
uniqueness or sorting of the output.
}
\examples{
idx <- c(5, 10)
offsets <- -1:1
expand_indices(idx, offsets, max_len = 15)
