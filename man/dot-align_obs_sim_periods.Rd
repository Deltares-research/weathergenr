\title{Standardize obs and sim to the same full-year length via random windowing}
\usage{
.align_obs_sim_periods(daily_obs, daily_sim, n_realizations, variables)
}
\arguments{
\item{daily_obs}{List of observed data frames (one per grid).}

\item{daily_sim}{List of simulated realizations; each realization is a list of grids.}

\item{n_realizations}{Integer number of realizations.}

\item{variables}{Character vector of variables used for evaluation.}
}
\value{
List with standardized `daily_obs`, `daily_sim`, and window metadata.
}
\description{
Applies the chosen window consistently across all grids and all realizations
after removing leap days. The window is drawn from the longest contiguous
full-year blocks available in each series.
