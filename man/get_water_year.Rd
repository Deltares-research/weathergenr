\title{Calculate Water Year from Date Vector}
\usage{
get_water_year(date, water.year.first.month = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{A vector of `Date` objects.}

\item{water.year.first.month}{Integer (1-12) indicating the first month of the water year.
For example, `10` for October or `6` for June.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of the same length as `date`, giving the water year of each date.

#' @examples
# Water year starting in October (common in US hydrology)
dates <- as.Date(c("2022-09-30", "2022-10-01", "2023-06-15"))
get_water_year(dates, water.year.first.month = 10)
# [1] 2022 2023 2023

# Water year starting in June (e.g., for monsoon-driven systems)
dates <- as.Date(c("2023-05-31", "2023-06-01", "2023-12-01"))
get_water_year(dates, water.year.first.month = 6)
# [1] 2023 2024 2024

# Default: calendar year (Jan-Dec)
dates <- as.Date(c("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31"))
get_water_year(dates)
# [1] 2024 2024#'
}
\description{
Assigns a water year to each date in a vector based on a custom starting month.
Common in hydrology, a water year groups months across calendar years (e.g., Oct-Sep).
}
