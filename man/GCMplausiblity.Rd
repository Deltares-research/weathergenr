\usage{
GCMplausiblity(
  str.data = NULL,
  gcm.data = NULL,
  gcm.scenario.list = c("ssp126", "ssp245", "ssp370", "ssp585"),

}
\arguments{
\item{str.data}{Data frame. Climate response surface with columns for x (precip), y (temp), and z (metric of interest)
plus `statistic` and location identifier. Typically produced by a climate stress-test workflow.}

\item{gcm.data}{Data frame. GCM projections, must include columns for `prcp`, `tavg`, `scenario`, and optionally `location`.}

\item{gcm.scenario.list}{Character vector. GCM scenario names to include (default: c("ssp126", "ssp245", "ssp370", "ssp585")).}

\item{clevel.list}{Numeric vector. List of probability levels for GCM ellipses (e.g., c(0.5, 0.95)).}

\item{metric.list}{Character vector. List of metric names (e.g., c("reliability", "failure_prob")) to summarize.}

\item{metric.labs}{Character vector. Labels for metrics (used in output; defaults to metric.list).}

\item{location.list}{Character vector. locations or system units to summarize (must match column in str.data/gcm.data).}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) with the following columns:
  - `location`: location name.
  - `metric`: metric name.
  - `Baseline`: metric value at baseline (no climate change).
  - Additional columns for each probability level in `clevel.list` (e.g., "CL:50%", "CL:95%"), containing
    the plausible range ("min to max") of metric values within the GCM ellipse for each location and metric.
}
\description{
Calculates the plausible range of climate impact metrics (e.g., system performance, failure probability)
for a set of locations and metrics, based on the overlap between user-provided climate response surfaces (`str.data`)
and the distribution of future climate change as projected by General Circulation Models (GCMs, `gcm.data`).
For each metric and location, the function extracts the range of metric values falling within GCM ellipses
(e.g., 50% and 95% probability contours) in delta-precipitation/delta-temperature space.

The main application is to support "plausibility" or "stress-testing" analyses in climate risk assessments.
}
\details{
For each location/metric, interpolates the response surface, finds points within the specified GCM probability ellipse
(in climate space), and records the range of metric values within that region. Useful for reporting GCM-informed
plausible ranges of change for each system/metric.
