\arguments{
\item{weather.data}{A named list of data frames containing daily weather observations for each grid cell. Each data frame should have one column per weather variable (e.g., precipitation, temperature) and one row per day.}

\item{weather.grid}{A data frame describing the spatial layout of grid cells. Must include columns `id` (unique grid identifier starting from 1), `xind`, `yind` (index positions), and spatial coordinates `x`, `y`.}

\item{weather.date}{A vector of `Date` objects corresponding to the daily time series in `weather.data`. The same date vector should apply to all grid cells.}

\item{variable.names}{A character vector of names of weather variables to be included in the simulation (e.g., `c("precip", "temp")`).}

\item{variable.labels}{Optional character vector of human-readable labels corresponding to `variable.names`. Defaults to `variable.names` if not provided.}

\item{sim.year.num}{Integer specifying the total number of years to generate in each synthetic weather realization.}

\item{sim.year.start}{Integer indicating the first year of the synthetic weather time series (e.g., 2020).}

\item{month.start}{Integer indicating the first month of the hydrological (or water) year. Defaults to `1` (January).}

\item{realization.num}{Number of independent stochastic realizations (i.e., synthetic weather traces) to simulate.}

\item{warm.variable}{Name of the weather variable used for Wavelet Autoregressive Modeling (WARM). Typically this is a low-frequency driver like precipitation. Defaults to `"precip"`.}

\item{warm.signif.level}{Significance level (between 0 and 1) for retaining low-frequency components during wavelet decomposition. Higher values retain fewer components.}

\item{warm.sample.num}{Number of annual time series realizations to generate using the WARM model prior to filtering with statistical criteria.}

\item{warm.subset.criteria}{A named list of numeric thresholds used to filter annual time series generated by WARM, based on summary statistics such as `mean`, `sd`, `min`, `max`, `sig.thr`, and `nsig.thr`.}

\item{knn.sample.num}{Number of historical years to sample from using the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method during daily weather reconstruction.}

\item{mc.wet.quantile}{Quantile threshold (between 0 and 1) defining "wet" days for Markov Chain state modeling. Days above this threshold are considered wet.}

\item{mc.extreme.quantile}{Quantile threshold (between 0 and 1) for identifying "extremely wet" days, used for refining Markov Chain transitions.}

\item{dry.spell.change}{A numeric vector of length 12 specifying monthly adjustment factors for dry spell lengths (e.g., `1` = no change, `>1` = longer spells). Defaults to `rep(1, 12)`.}

\item{wet.spell.change}{A numeric vector of length 12 specifying monthly adjustment factors for wet spell lengths (e.g., `1` = no change, `>1` = longer spells). Defaults to `rep(1, 12)`.}

\item{output.path}{File path to the directory where generated output files, such as figures and NetCDFs, will be saved.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer used to initialize random number generation for reproducible results. If not provided, a random seed is chosen.}

\item{compute.parallel}{Logical; if `TRUE`, parallel processing is enabled for performance-intensive steps.}

\item{num.cores}{Integer specifying the number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. If `NULL`, all available cores minus one are used.}

\item{save.rdata}{Logical; if `TRUE`, saves intermediate R objects to disk in `.RData` format for debugging or reuse.}
