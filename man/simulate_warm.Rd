\usage{
simulate_warm(
  components = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  n_sim = 1000,
  seed = NULL,
  series_obs = NULL,
  bypass_n = 15L,
  match_variance = TRUE,
  var_tol = 0.1,
  check_diagnostics = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{components}{Matrix, data.frame, or list of numeric vectors. Wavelet
components. In component mode, each component must have length n. In bypass
mode, components are only used to reconstruct the original series if
series_obs is not provided.}

\item{n}{Integer. Length of each simulated series.}

\item{n_sim}{Integer. Number of realizations to generate. Default is 1000.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Base RNG seed for reproducibility.}

\item{series_obs}{Optional numeric vector. Observed original series. Provide
this in bypass mode to avoid reconstructing the series from components.}

\item{bypass_n}{Integer. Threshold for bypass mode. Default is 25.}

\item{match_variance}{Logical. If TRUE, rescale simulated outputs to match
observed standard deviation when relative mismatch exceeds var_tol.}

\item{var_tol}{Numeric in [0, 1]. Relative standard deviation tolerance.}

\item{check_diagnostics}{Logical. If TRUE, runs a Ljung Box test on ARMA
residuals and warns when residual autocorrelation remains.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints informational messages.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with dimension n by n_sim. Each column is a simulated
  realization.
}
\description{
Generates n_sim synthetic realizations of length n.

Two operating modes are supported.

Component mode (n >= bypass_n)
- Each wavelet component is centered.
- A stationary non seasonal ARMA(p,q) model is fit once per component using a
  grid search over p in 0..max_p and q in 0..max_q with AIC selection.
- Simulations are generated from the selected ARMA model using a fixed
  simulator (no S3 simulate dispatch).
- Component means are re added and components are summed.
- If fitting fails for a component, a block bootstrap fallback is used for
  that component only.

Bypass mode (n < bypass_n)
- Component simulation is skipped.
- A stationary non seasonal ARMA(p,q) model is fit to the original series and
  simulated directly.
- If fitting fails, a block bootstrap fallback is used.
}
\details{
ARMA configuration
- Non seasonal: seasonal terms are not considered.
- Stationary: fits enforce stationarity constraints via parameter transforms.
- No drift and no mean: include.mean is FALSE. The code centers series before
  fitting and re adds the observed mean after simulation.

Fallback logic
- Fallback is applied per component in component mode. Components that fit
  successfully use ARMA simulation; failed components use block bootstrap.
- In bypass mode, fallback is applied to the whole series.
