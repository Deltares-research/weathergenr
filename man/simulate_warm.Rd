\usage{
simulate_warm(
  components = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  n_sim = 1000,
  seed = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{components}{Matrix, data.frame, or list of numeric vectors. Wavelet components.
If \code{n < 25}, components are used only to reconstruct the original series if
\code{series_obs} is not supplied.}

\item{n}{Integer. Length of each simulated series.}

\item{n_sim}{Integer. Number of realizations to generate. Default is 1000.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Base RNG seed for reproducibility.}

\item{series_obs}{Optional numeric vector. Observed original series. Recommended when
\code{n < 25} so bypass-mode does not rely on reconstructing from components.}

\item{bypass_n}{Integer. If \code{n < bypass_n}, bypass wavelet-component modeling and
fit AR/ARMA on the original series. Default is 25.}

\item{match_variance}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), rescales each simulated
component (or bypass-series) to match the observed standard deviation when the
relative difference exceeds \code{var_tol}.}

\item{var_tol}{Numeric in [0, 1]. Relative tolerance used to trigger variance rescaling.
Default is 0.1 (10 percent).}

\item{check_diagnostics}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, runs simple ARIMA diagnostics (Ljung-Box)
and warns on issues. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), emits informational logs.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of dimension \code{n x n_sim}. Each column is a simulated realization.
}
\description{
Simulates synthetic series by either:
\enumerate{
  \item (Default, n >= 25) Modeling each wavelet component with an ARIMA model,
  simulating each component forward, and summing across components; or
  \item (Fallback, n < 25) Bypassing wavelet modeling and fitting a simple AR/ARMA
  model directly on the original series, then simulating forward.
}
}
\details{
Key implementation choices (component mode, n >= bypass_n):
\itemize{
  \item Components are simulated independently and summed.
  \item Components are centered before ARIMA fitting; the observed component mean is re-added.
  \item Smooth components (names starting with \code{"S"}) are constrained to AR(1)
    (\code{max.p=1, max.q=0}) to reduce spurious low-frequency oscillations.
  \item Mean/drift terms are disabled in ARIMA fitting (\code{include.mean=FALSE},
    \code{allowdrift=FALSE}) because components are explicitly centered.
  \item If ARIMA fitting fails for a component, the component is simulated by bootstrap
    resampling with replacement from the observed component values.
}

Bypass mode (n < bypass_n):
\itemize{
  \item A simple stationary AR/ARMA model is fit to the original series.
  \item The model is simulated forward using \code{stats::simulate}.
  \item Optional variance matching is applied to the simulated series.
}
