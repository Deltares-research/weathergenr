\usage{
filter_warm_simulations(
  series.obs = NULL,
  series.sim = NULL,
  sample.num = 5,
  seed = NULL,
  padding = TRUE,
  relax.order = c("wavelet", "sd", "tail_low", "tail_high", "mean"),
  bounds = list(),
  wavelet.pars = list(signif.level = 0.8, noise.type = "red", period.lower.limit = 2,
    detrend = TRUE),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{series.obs}{Numeric vector. Observed annual series (no missing values recommended).}

\item{series.sim}{Numeric matrix. Simulated annual series with years in rows and
realizations in columns.}

\item{sample.num}{Integer scalar. Number of realizations to return in \code{sampled}.
If greater than \code{ncol(series.sim)}, it is reduced to \code{ncol(series.sim)} with a warning.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Random seed used for window selection (if lengths differ)
and for sampling from the final candidate pool.}

\item{padding}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, expands the observed significant-period
set by one index on each side when assessing presence of observed-relevant signal
in simulated spectra.}

\item{relax.order}{Character vector. Relaxation priority ordering for criteria.
Must contain each of \code{c("mean","sd","tail_low","tail_high","wavelet")} exactly once.
When multiple filters have identical pass rates, this order is used to break ties.}

\item{bounds}{Named list. Filtering thresholds and relaxation controls. Any entry
provided overrides the defaults. Common entries include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{mean}, \code{sd}: relative-difference tolerances for mean and sd.
  \item \code{tail.low.p}, \code{tail.high.p}: quantiles defining lower/upper tail thresholds.
  \item \code{tail.tol.log}: tolerance on log-distance between simulated and observed tail mass.
  \item \code{tail.eps}: epsilon added to tail mass before log transform for stability.
  \item \code{sig.frac}: minimum fraction of observed-relevant regions required to pass the wavelet filter.
  \item \code{wavelet.region.tol}, \code{wavelet.contrast.tol}: tolerances for regional power and contrast ratios.
  \item \code{wavelet.require_presence}, \code{wavelet.presence.frac}: controls for requiring signal presence.
  \item \code{relax.*}: relaxation step sizes and caps (including \code{relax.max.iter}).
}}

\item{wavelet.pars}{Named list passed to \code{\link{wavelet_spectral_analysis}} for
observed and simulated series. Typical entries include \code{signif.level},
\code{noise.type}, \code{period.lower.limit}, and \code{detrend}.}

\item{make.plots}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, returns diagnostic plots (time series overlay,
relative-difference summaries, and wavelet GWS diagnostics) in \code{plots}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, logs per-iteration pass rates and relaxation steps
using \code{logger::log_info()}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
  \item{subsetted}{Numeric matrix. All realizations that remain in the final candidate pool
    (columns subset of \code{series.sim}).}
  \item{sampled}{Numeric matrix. \code{sample.num} realizations sampled from the final pool
    (columns subset of \code{series.sim}).}
  \item{filter_summary}{Data frame summarizing pass counts and pass rates by criterion, and the
    final selection mode (tiered relaxation vs fallback).}
  \item{diagnostics}{List containing window metadata, pool/sample indices, relaxation log, and
    final parameter values used for filtering.}
  \item{plots}{NULL or a named list of ggplot objects when \code{make.plots = TRUE}.}
}
}
\description{
Filters a set of WARM realizations (simulated annual series) against an observed
annual series using three tiers of checks:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Distributional}: relative differences in mean and standard deviation,
  \item \strong{Tail behavior}: lower/upper tail mass relative to observed quantile thresholds,
  \item \strong{Spectral}: an observed-relevant global wavelet spectrum (GWS) filter.
}

If fewer than \code{sample.num} realizations pass, the function relaxes criteria
iteratively (up to \code{bounds$relax.max.iter}) by loosening the currently
most restrictive active filter. If still insufficient, a deterministic fallback
returns the \code{sample.num} realizations with the smallest absolute relative
mean difference.
}
\details{
\strong{Length harmonization}:
The evaluation is performed over \code{n_use = min(length(series.obs), nrow(series.sim))}.
If the observed series is longer than \code{n_use}, one contiguous window of length \code{n_use}
is sampled and used for all comparisons. If simulated realizations are longer than \code{n_use},
each realization is evaluated on its own sampled contiguous window of length \code{n_use}.
Returned series in \code{subsetted} and \code{sampled} always use the original rows from
\code{series.sim} (no trimming in the outputs).

\strong{Tail-mass metrics}:
Lower and upper thresholds are defined by the observed quantiles at
\code{bounds$tail.low.p} and \code{bounds$tail.high.p}. Tail behavior is summarized as
normalized deficit/excess mass relative to those thresholds, and compared using a
stabilized log-distance with \code{bounds$tail.eps}.

\strong{Wavelet filter (observed-relevant GWS)}:
The observed GWS is tested against its significance curve to identify significant periods,
which are grouped into contiguous regions. For each realization, regional integrated power
and region-to-background contrast are compared to the observed within the specified
tolerances, requiring at least \code{bounds$sig.frac} of regions to pass. Optional
presence checks ensure simulated power exceeds a minimum fraction of observed power in
the observed-relevant band.
