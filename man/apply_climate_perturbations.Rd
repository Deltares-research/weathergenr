\usage{

\arguments{
\item{climate.data}{List of data frames, one per grid cell. Each data frame must
contain columns \code{precip}, \code{temp}, \code{temp_min}, \code{temp_max},
and optionally \code{pet}.}

\item{climate.grid}{Data frame containing grid cell metadata. Must include a
column \code{y} representing latitude in decimal degrees.}

\item{sim.dates}{Vector of \code{Date} objects corresponding to the rows of each
element in \code{climate.data}.}

\item{change.factor.precip.mean}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly
multiplicative factors for precipitation mean representing the desired average
change over the simulation period.}

\item{change.factor.precip.variance}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly
multiplicative factors applied to precipitation variance.}

\item{change.factor.temp.mean}{Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly additive
temperature changes in degrees Celsius representing the desired average change.}

\item{transient.temp.change}{Logical. If TRUE, temperature changes increase
linearly from zero to twice the specified factor so that the target mean change
is achieved. If FALSE, the full factor is applied uniformly.}

\item{transient.precip.change}{Logical. If TRUE, precipitation change factors
increase linearly from 1.0 to a calculated endpoint that yields the target mean.
If FALSE, the full factor is applied uniformly.}

\item{calculate.pet}{Logical. If TRUE, potential evapotranspiration is
recalculated from perturbed temperatures using the Hargreaves method.}

\item{fit.method}{Character string specifying the distribution fitting method
passed to \code{quantile_mapping}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, progress messages are printed.}
}
\value{
A list of data frames with the same structure as \code{climate.data},
  containing perturbed weather variables. Invalid values are replaced with zero.
}
\description{
Applies climate change perturbations to gridded daily weather data by modifying
precipitation and temperature using monthly change factors. Perturbations can be
applied as step changes or gradual transient changes. Both approaches are
constructed to yield the same mean change over the simulation period.
}
\details{
Climate change perturbations are applied using the following mechanisms:

\itemize{
  \item Precipitation is adjusted using quantile mapping with mean and variance scaling.
  \item Temperature variables are adjusted using additive monthly shifts.
  \item Potential evapotranspiration is recalculated using the Hargreaves equation
  when requested.
}

Step and transient perturbations are formulated to produce the same mean change
over the full simulation period. Step changes apply the specified factor
uniformly across all years. Transient changes increase linearly from a baseline
to an endpoint that yields the same mean effect.

For precipitation, transient factors ramp from 1.0 to a computed upper value.
For temperature, transient changes ramp from zero to twice the specified mean
change. This ensures comparability between step and transient scenarios while
representing different temporal pathways.

During transient precipitation adjustments, a minimum factor of 0.01 is enforced
to prevent numerical instabilities.
