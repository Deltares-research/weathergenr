CONTEXT
You are modifying an R package named weathergenr.

GOAL
Improve correctness, readability, maintainability, and testability.
Changes must be minimal and surgical.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (non-negotiable)
Keep all files UTF-8.
Do not change exported function names, arguments, or return structures unless explicitly instructed.
Do not add new external dependencies; prefer base R and existing Imports. If unavoidable, justify briefly.
Do not introduce purrr or functional-programming rewrites; use explicit for loops.
Preserve deterministic behavior (control seeds/randomness where relevant).
Do not reformat entire files or apply style-only sweeps.
Do not change user-visible outputs unless explicitly requested.
Do not silently drop columns or fields.

NON-INTERACTIVE EXECUTION (mandatory)
Do not ask questions or request confirmation.
Do not provide interim progress updates.
Execute end-to-end in a single pass.
If information is missing or ambiguous, apply the smallest safe assumption consistent with package conventions.
Iterate until relevant tests pass, or only a clearly external/irreproducible failure remains; report that failure only in the final summary.
Stop only when all requested changes are implemented and tests have been updated and run.

PACKAGE CONVENTIONS (weathergenr)
Internal helpers: .helper_name()
User-facing functions: snake_case
Argument names: snake_case, descriptive
User-facing errors: stop(..., call. = FALSE)
Use warning() sparingly; use logger only if already present in the file
Qualify non-imported base packages (stats::, utils::, etc.)

STYLE
Prefer guard clauses and early returns.
Use explicit type/length checks; validate scalars with existing helpers (e.g., .is_int_scalar()).
Avoid deep nesting; extract small helpers only when it improves readability.
Naming consistency: obs_*, sim_*, cfg, out, idx, n_*, is_*.

DOCUMENTATION
Exported functions: update roxygen2 to match behavior exactly.
@description: single paragraph
@details: key assumptions and edge cases (brief)
@param: precise types/dimensions/units; NA handling
@return: exact structure/class/fields
@examples: minimal and fast; wrap expensive code in \dontrun{}
Internal functions: minimal docs, @keywords internal only if needed.
Do not invent parameters or behavior.

TESTS
Add or adjust testthat tests only when behavior changes or gaps exist.
Tests must be deterministic; avoid network, large fixtures, or uncontrolled randomness.
Cover: input validation, NA handling, empty/constant series, methodological consistency, return structure.
Group tests by function or function group.
At the top of each test file, list functions under test with relative paths.

FINAL OUTPUT (once complete)
Bullet summary: what changed, why, risks/assumptions.
List of files changed.
Explicitly state any design choices made.

SCOPE: 
evaluate_generator.R
evaluate_generator_plots.R

TASK
Fix function argument names for consistency with other scripts:
 - In evaluate_weather_generator():
	- Rename "variables" as "vars"
	- Rename "wet_quantile" as "wet_q"
	- Rename "extreme_quantile" as "extreme_q"
	- Rename "max_grids" as "eval_max_grids"
