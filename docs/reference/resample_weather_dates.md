# Resample Daily Weather Dates Using Annual KNN and Markov Chain Logic

Resamples daily precipitation and temperature sequences by combining:

- annual K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) selection of observed years,

- a three-state Markov chain for wet and dry spell persistence,

- daily KNN resampling on precipitation and temperature anomalies.

The function supports both calendar-year and water-year simulations. The
regime is inferred automatically from \`year_start_month\`: if
\`year_start_month == 1\`, calendar-year logic is used; otherwise,
water-year logic is assumed.

## Usage

``` r
resample_weather_dates(
  annual_prcp_sim,
  annual_prcp_obs,
  daily_prcp_obs,
  daily_temp_obs,
  sim_start_year,
  realization_id,
  n_sim_years,
  obs_dates_table,
  sim_dates_table,
  year_start_month = 1,
  annual_knn_n = 50,
  wet_q = 0.2,
  extreme_q = 0.8,
  dry_spell_factor = rep(1, 12),
  wet_spell_factor = rep(1, 12),
  seed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- annual_prcp_sim:

  Numeric vector of length \`n_sim_years\`. Synthetic annual
  precipitation totals generated by the annual model (e.g., WARM),
  indexed by simulated year.

- annual_prcp_obs:

  Numeric vector. Observed annual precipitation totals corresponding to
  historical water years.

- daily_prcp_obs:

  Numeric vector. Observed daily precipitation values (no leap days),
  aligned with \`obs_dates_table\`.

- daily_temp_obs:

  Numeric vector. Observed daily temperature values (no leap days),
  aligned with \`obs_dates_table\`.

- sim_start_year:

  Integer. First simulation year (calendar year if \`year_start_month ==
  1\`, otherwise first water year).

- realization_id:

  Integer. Realization index, used to perturb the random seed so that
  multiple realizations are independent.

- n_sim_years:

  Integer. Number of simulated years.

- obs_dates_table:

  Data frame containing observed date information. Must include columns
  \`date\`, \`month\`, \`day\`, and \`wyear\`.

- sim_dates_table:

  Data frame containing simulated date information (no leap days). Must
  include columns \`month\`, \`day\`, and \`wyear\`.

- year_start_month:

  Integer in 1:12. First month of the simulation year. Use 1 for
  calendar-year simulations, or another month for water-year
  simulations.

- annual_knn_n:

  Integer. Number of historical years sampled in the annual KNN step.

- wet_q:

  Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile used to define the wet threshold for
  daily precipitation states.

- extreme_q:

  Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile used to define the very wet
  (extreme) precipitation threshold.

- dry_spell_factor:

  Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly adjustment factors controlling
  dry spell persistence in the Markov chain.

- wet_spell_factor:

  Numeric vector of length 12. Monthly adjustment factors controlling
  wet spell persistence in the Markov chain.

- seed:

  Optional integer. Base random seed for reproducibility.

## Value

A \`Date\` vector of length equal to \`nrow(sim_dates_table)\`, giving
the resampled observed dates corresponding to each simulated day.

## Details

For each simulated year, a subset of observed water years is selected
using annual KNN matching against \`annual_prcp_sim\`. Daily weather is
then generated sequentially:

1.  The first day of each simulated year is sampled from observed days
    matching the simulated month and day.

2.  Subsequent days are generated using a Markov chain to simulate wet
    and dry states.

3.  Conditional on the simulated state, candidate observed days are
    selected using calendar constraints and expanded search windows.

4.  A daily KNN step on precipitation and temperature anomalies is used
    to select the next-day weather values.

In calendar-year mode (\`year_start_month == 1\`), transitions that
cross December to January are explicitly excluded to avoid cross-year
contamination.
