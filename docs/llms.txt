# Overview

*weathergenr* is an R package for generating synthetic weather series
using a multivariate, gridded, stochastic weather generator. It builds
on the methodology introduced by [Steinscheineder et al
(2013)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wrcr.20528),
and provides an efficient, user-friendly implementation tailored for
climate and hydrological studies.

Key features include:

📂 Support for gridded NetCDF datasets  
⚙️ Script automation and enhanced usability  
⚡ Significant performance gains via vectorized and parallelized code

# Installation
